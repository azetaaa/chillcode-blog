# ChillCode Blog

Welcome to my personal blog, where I share technical programming problems in a simple and easy-to-follow format. 
From classical coding questions about algorithms and data structures to system-design breakdowns, anything goes here.

My goal is to share what I'm learning in a way that anyone can understand, even absolute beginners should have an easy time going over the articles in the blog.
So take your time, grab a nice cup of coffee, and enjoy!

The blog itself is based on a lovely [Next.js + Tailwind CSS blogging starter template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.git) by @timlrx. The template is built upon [pliny](https://github.com/timlrx/pliny) and [contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer), and I also use TypeScript by default.
