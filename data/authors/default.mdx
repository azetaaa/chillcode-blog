Hej there, My name is Andrea, I own a computer and I code things.

When I'm not working, you can find me roaming around the internet. I spend my time exploring new technologies and building weird software products, and I'm always looking for ways to learn new stuff.

This blog is a call-to-action to my lazy self: I must share something (even small) every day. Since my dream is to have a job that allows me to be professionaly curious and where I'm constantly learning, I though I'd share what little I know first.

Always open to new ideas and to meet interesting folk, feel free to reach out anytime. Have a nice day pal.
